# Coursera Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project
This project content the R code and information for Getting and Cleanning Data Course available in Coursera.
The code will be named run_analysis.R and perfom 5 steps described below:

1- Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.

2- Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.

3- Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.

4- Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.

5- From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
